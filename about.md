I'm Sashi Kumar. I'm a Software Developer and I live in Chennai, India.

I love playing & watching `Football`. I am a great fan of `Cristiano Ronaldo` and `Lionel Messi` ( both ![Wink][wUrl]). Yeah it sounds really odd! But, I would rather say, `I'm a fan of the beautiful game` rather than fan of either Cristiano or Messi.    

I am a graduate from `College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG)`. I have a great passion towards `Machine Learning`, but still a beginner in the same. 

I love exploring new things and meeting new people!
